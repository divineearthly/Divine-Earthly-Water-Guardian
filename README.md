# 🌊 Divine Earthly Water Guardian (DEWG)
**"Harmonizing Earth's Vitals through Vedic-Quantum Intelligence"**

## 🔱 Vision
The Divine Earthly Water Guardian is a monitoring and optimization system designed to protect and revitalize water bodies. By integrating **Quantum Physics** and **Vedic Formulas**, DEWG creates a "Vitality Index" for water resources, moving beyond simple data collection toward true environmental harmony.

## 🧬 The Core Logic: Vedic-Quantum Optimization
This project utilizes a specific **Vedic Constant ($1.08$)** to calibrate environmental data.
* **Input:** Real-time satellite data (NASA SMAP for Soil Moisture & Sentinel-2 for NDWI).
* **Processing:** A Quantum-Vedic engine that calculates the "Prana" (Life Force) of the water body.
* **Output:** Precise health scores that trigger alerts when the ecological balance is disrupted.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Tools:** Google Colab, Pydroid 3, Termux
* **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
* **Future Hardware:** IoT-enabled sensors (ESP32/Arduino) for localized physical monitoring.

## 🚀 How to Run (Google Colab)
1. Open the `Water_Guardian_Colab.ipynb` file.
2. Run the environment setup cell to install dependencies.
3. Execute the `DivineWaterGuardian` engine to begin the simulation.
